# FAQ: covid vaccine questions

Like most of us, I get drawn into covid vaccination debates. Since I like to crunch raw data,
I thought I'd create a github repository to put data. This way, people can prove me wrong
by issueing "pull requests" with data that challenges my conclusions.

My bias is typically "libertarian", meaning anti-mandate but pro-vaccine. In other words,
the science shows clearly vaccines are in your best interest, but government mandates are
unreasonable and ineffective.

As a libertarian, I believe questions are and open debate are how we acquire knowledge.
The left-wing "appeal to authority" is thus invalid on its face. On the other hand,
it's sort of justified by the way the right-wing is full of people who are uninterested
in answers to the questions they ask (famously, those like Tucker Carlson on Fox News).

In this repository, I strive to find responses to the questions. My responses are
probably erroneous, but that's what GitHub is for, so that people can post corrections.

Some questions:
 - What about the UK data showing you are more likely to be infected if vaccinated?
